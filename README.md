# Property Management Dashboard

This repository contains a full-stack property management prototype built with **Next.js (App Router)** and **NestJS**, using **PostgreSQL** as the database and **Prisma ORM** for data access.

The project demonstrates a clean and scalable approach to building a **Property Management Dashboard** with a **draft-based creation flow**, a **multi-step wizard**, and a clear **Property → Buildings → Units** domain model.

The main focus of the project is **architecture, data flow correctness, and predictable UX**, rather than visual polish or feature completeness.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

- Design a clear and extensible **real estate domain model**
- Implement a **draft-first creation flow** for complex entities
- Build a **stable dashboard UI** with a multi-step wizard
- Avoid common frontend pitfalls:
  - silent form submit failures
  - hidden HTML validation bugs
  - unclear source-of-truth for data
- Demonstrate production-ready patterns in:
  - NestJS + Prisma
  - Next.js App Router
  - complex form workflows

## 🧱 Domain Model
Property
├─ Buildings (1..n)
│   └─ Units (0..n)
│       └─ UnitOwners (0..n)  ← many-to-many join table
│           └─ Owners

### Property
Represents a managed real estate object.

- Has a management type (`WEG` or `MV`)
- Assigned to a manager and an accountant (both reference `users`)
- Stores business-level fields: name, purpose, unique number

### Building
Represents a physical building belonging to a property.

- Address-based entity (street, house number, city, postal code)
- Ordered within a property via `order_index`
- Acts as a parent for units

### Unit
Represents an individual unit (apartment, office, parking, garden, etc.).

- Belongs to exactly one building
- Has physical and legal attributes (size, floor, rooms, co-ownership share)
- Can be co-owned by multiple owners via `unit_owners`

### Owner
Represents a real person who owns one or more units.

- Linked to units via the `unit_owners` join table
- Each ownership record stores a `share` percentage

### UnitOwner (many-to-many)
Join table between `units` and `owners`.

- Composite primary key: `(unit_id, owner_id)`
- Stores the ownership share per unit per owner

## 🗄 Database Overview (PostgreSQL)

The database runs via **Docker** and is managed through **Prisma Migrations**.

### Properties Table
```sql

### Performance Indexes

| Index | Table | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `properties_manager_id_idx` | properties | Filter/JOIN by manager |
| `properties_accountant_id_idx` | properties | Filter/JOIN by accountant |
| `properties_management_type_idx` | properties | Filter by WEG/MV |
| `buildings_property_id_idx` | buildings | JOIN buildings → properties |
| `units_building_id_idx` | units | JOIN units → buildings |
| `units_type_idx` | units | Filter by unit type |
| `unit_owners_owner_id_idx` | unit_owners | JOIN unit_owners → owners |

### Data

The database is seeded with realistic demo data via `seed.sql`:

| Table | Records |
|-------|---------|
| users | 4 |
| properties | 3 |
| buildings | 5 |
| units | 13 |
| owners | 8 |
| unit_owners | 10 |

Data was manually crafted to represent realistic German property management scenarios including co-owned units, mixed unit types, and multiple buildings per property.

## 🔑 Key Characteristics

This project is built around a set of deliberate architectural and UX decisions aimed at creating a stable and predictable system.

### Draft‑First Workflow
- Properties can exist in a `draft` state
- Drafts allow users to incrementally fill complex data
- No implicit activation — state transitions are explicit

### Single Source of Truth
- Core business fields (`name`, `managementType`, `manager`, `accountant`)
  are stored and read from the backend
- The UI never relies on hardcoded fallbacks once data is provided
- Prevents data divergence between frontend state and database

### Stable Form Handling
- Native HTML validation is fully disabled in wizard forms
- All validation is handled explicitly in JavaScript
- Eliminates silent submit failures in multi-step workflows

### Predictable Navigation
- Submit logic exists only in client components
- Redirects happen strictly after successful `await` of API calls
- No hidden side effects (`useEffect`, server actions, etc.)

### Intentional Scope Control
- No delete flow for properties (removed due to instability at this stage)
- No backend aggregation logic yet
- Focus is on correctness, not feature quantity

## 🔧 Backend Architecture

The backend follows a **modular NestJS architecture** with a strong emphasis on
type safety and separation of concerns.

### Core Principles
- Each domain is isolated in its own module
- Prisma is injected via a dedicated `PrismaModule`
- DTOs are strictly separated from entities
- Enums are used consistently for domain concepts

## 🖥 Frontend Overview

The frontend is a **Next.js (App Router)** application responsible for
displaying the Property Dashboard and handling the property creation wizard.

Its main responsibilities are:
- displaying properties and their current state
- guiding the user through a multi-step creation flow
- sending validated data to the backend
- handling navigation and redirects

The frontend does not contain business logic or hidden state —
the backend is the single source of truth.

## ✅ What the Frontend Does

- Renders a **property dashboard** with card-based layout
- Displays property status (`draft` / `active`) and management type (`WEG` / `MV`)
- Opens a **property preview dialog** on card click
- Provides entry points to continue or complete a property wizard
- Implements a **multi-step property creation wizard**:
  1. General Info
  2. Buildings
  3. Units
- Validates and submits user input to the backend
- Redirects the user after successful operations

---

## ⚠️ Key Notes

- The frontend disables native HTML validation in wizard forms
- All submit logic runs in client components
- Redirects occur only after successful API calls
- No business logic or aggregation is handled on the frontend

The frontend is intentionally kept **simple, predictable, and stable**.

### Modules Overview

- **PropertiesModule**
  - Draft creation and update logic
  - Core business entity
- **BuildingsModule**
  - Buildings belonging to a property
  - Ordered within a property
- **UnitsModule**
  - Units belonging to buildings
  - Physical and legal attributes
- **UsersModule**
  - Basic user management
  - Password hashing
- **PrismaModule**
  - Centralized Prisma client
- **DatabaseModule**
  - Database initialization and seeding
- **HealthModule**
  - Health check endpoint

### API Design

The backend exposes a simple REST API:
```text
# Health
GET    /api/health

# Properties
GET    /api/properties
POST   /api/properties
GET    /api/properties/:id
PATCH  /api/properties/:id
DELETE /api/properties/:id

# Buildings
GET    /api/properties/:propertyId/buildings
POST   /api/properties/:propertyId/buildings

# Owners
GET    /api/owners
POST   /api/owners
GET    /api/owners/top
GET    /api/owners/stats/area
POST   /api/owners/units/:unitId/assign
GET    /api/owners/units/:unitId
```

Currently the backend exposes endpoints for listing and creating properties, which is enough to power the Property Dashboard and start the creation wizard.
The remaining endpoints for buildings and units follow the same REST structure and can be added incrementally
